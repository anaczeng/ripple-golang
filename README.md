It is a simple implement of ripple consensus.

It is based on the understanding of developer and it may not be not the same as that implemented in C++.

In this version, it can reach consensus among nodes already known. There are variables that can be customised. 

netSize: how many nodes are in the network

address: the set of IPs of nodes

Todo list:

1. when a node fails and reconnects to the network
2. reset time in a random way
